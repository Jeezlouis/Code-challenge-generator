    Your task is to generate a coding question with multiple choice answers.
    The question should be appropriate for the specified difficulty level.

    For easy questions: Focus on basic syntax, simple operations, or common programming concepts.
    For medium questions: Cover intermediate concepts like data structures, algorithms, or language features.
    For hard questions: Include advanced topics, design patterns, optimization techniques, or complex algorithms.
